Long-term trends in migration counts were estimated independently for each species, site and season using a Bayesian hierarchical GAM framework with Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (R-INLA, Rue et al. 2017) in R (version 3.1.3; R Core Team 2014). We estimated trends using log-linear regression, which included a smooth effect for year (i) and day of year (j) to model temporal patterns in population trajectories and the seasonal distributions of counts, respectively. We fit a cubic regression spline using the package mgcv (Wood 2011) with approximately 1 knot for every 4 years of data (following Smith and Edwards 2020), and 1 knot for every 8 days of data. The number of knots controls for the upper limit on the complexity of the smoother. We also include random annual fluctuations around the smoothed year effects (YE) to model population trajectories (similar to Smith and Edwards 2020), with an independent and identically distributed (IID) hierarchical year term (i.e., GAMYE).

Indices of Abundance The population trajectory for each species, site and season were defined be the collection of estimated annual indices of abundance (ni). These indices are calculated as the exponential mean daily count from the posterior distribution of the GAMYE model. We also calculated smoothed population trajectories for the GAMYE, as above, but without the parameter for annual fluctuations (YE). These smoothed indices (smooth_ni) provide an estimate of the medium and longer-term patterns of population change after removing the effect of the random annual fluctuations and form the basis of the trend calculations (Smith and Edwards 2020).

Trends Multiple metrics can be used to estimate a 'trend' from the estimated population trajectories. We provide endpoint trends calculated post-hoc from the smoothed population trajectories following methods outlined in the bbsBayes package (Edward and Smith 2021). Specifically, endpoint trend estimates are the geometric mean annual change (% per year) in the population trajectory, using an interval-specific ratio of the smoothed annual indices at the start and end of the time period (Sauer and Link 2011). 

Trend estimates and 95% credible intervals were back-transformed to annual rates of population change using 100\*exp(estimate)-1. Trend were calculated using the full dataset, as well as for the most recent 10-years, and three generations (Bird et al. 2020), the latter of which are informative to status assessments in Canada (e.g., see COSEWIC's Quantitative criteria and guideline for the status assessment of wildlife species). If the three-generation length was less than 10 years, the output reflects the 10-year trend.
