## The Canadian Migration Monitoring Network - RÃ©seau canadien de surveillance des migrations (CMMN-RCSM) 

The [Canadian Migration Monitoring Network (CMMN)](https://www.birdscanada.org/bird-science/canadian-migration-monitoring-network-cmmn) is a collaborative initiative of bird observatories across Canada, Birds Canada, and Environment and Climate Change Canada. The CMMN provides vital long-term information on bird demographics and population trends for more than 200 bird species, and contributes scientific data that advance the understanding of birds and other aspects of natural history in Canada.

Through its members, the network also provides novel training and education opportunities to the public, increasing their knowledge and understanding of Canadian birds and their conservation.

The CMMN aims to (1) generate high quality research and monitoring information on population trends, breeding and wintering areas, timing and routes of migration, stop-over sites and other aspects of avian ecology; and (2) influence bird conservation by making results readily accessible to member stations, the scientific community, wildlife managers and regulators, and the general public.

Member observatories conduct annual standardized migration monitoring and other research on migratory birds and other wildlife, serve as a training ground for aspiring students, biologists and researchers, and engage in various outreach and education activities. 

Environment and Climate Change Canada provides critical support and resources to a number of member stations and to Birds Canada for its roles in data archiving and analysis. Many research projects are led by or involve ECCC scientists and CMMN data are increasingly used in conservation assessments and plans.

Birds Canada is the administrative home for the CMMN. It manages and archives migration monitoring data for the network, regularly analyzes and produces population trends, and makes these data accessible to the public and other researchers through NatureCounts. Birds Canada also coordinates network-wide research projects and conducts various secretariat duties for the CMMN.
